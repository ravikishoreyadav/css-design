			<p>Hey all!</p>
			<p>This is Sam Garanzini from the Couples Therapy Training Academy…</p>
			<p>Let’s face it.</p>
			<p>Our industry changed overnight.</p>
			<p>Covid-19, the economy, social unrest, home schooling for all…</p>
			<p><b>But the relationship problems that people are facing didn’t change.
				</b></p>
			<p>Marriages are still struggling with affairs, attachment issues, PTSD/trauma, and high conflict.
			</p>
			<p><u>They now want you to fix their problems through telehealth.<b> Sounds impossible?</b>
				</u></p>
			<p>Many therapists are worried about how best to help couples during this time.</p>
			<p>Therapists are also worried about maintaining a stable income, navigating sliding scale requests, selling
				their online courses, and whether their workshops will return in the same manner prior to Covid-19.</p>
			<p>When it comes to worry and fear, I was right where you’re at many years ago.</p>
			<p>In 2008, during the worst financial crisis since the depression, my overpriced and newly-bought San
				Francisco condo was worth $200k less than I paid for it.</p>
			<p>was offering session-by-session therapy, and I was scared.</p>
			<p>For real.</p>
			<p>My husband and I figured it out the short-term and the long-term plan.</p>
			<p>We set an intention each day to pull ourselves out of that mess.</p>
			<p>And our clients.</p>
			<p>Most importantly, we reached out for help and developed connections with therapists we could trust.</p>
			<p>Given all that has happened recently, I had an idea…</p>
			<p><b>Let me tell you what we were thinking…</b></p>

			<div class="text-row">
				<p>I recently ran a survey to the therapists in my circle all about the struggles they’re experiencing
					with
					couples, especially as the world is changing around us.</p>
				<p><u><b>The survey results:</b></u> The major challenge that you seem to be experiencing is how to work
					with high conflict couples, relationships struggling with affairs, attachment wounds, or
					trauma/PTSD.</p>
				<p>To respond to the needs of your community, you want to learn how to do these things via telehealth.
				</p>
				<p>Some couples are happy to move online with you.</p>
				<p>A few are not. Now what?</p>
				<p>Based on the OVERWHELMING interest I recently created an<b>opportunity for a SMALL number of
						clinicians to work with myself, and several guest speakers,</b> all trained in sub-specialities
					to help you become successful.

				<div class="faq-text">
					<br />
					<h3>How does the High Conflict Couples Masterclass work?</h3><br />
					<p>We met with a small group of clinicians in May 2020 to build the course curriculum, and then

						recovery, and high conflict couples.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="faq-text">
					<br />
					<h3>How much does this cost?</h3><br />
					<p>This kind of clinical Masterclass experience normally would cost upwards of $2000 in case
						consultation expenses, and business knowledge you receive. We’ve included an additional $1695 in
						bonus material to ensure your success. <i>But, because of all the changes in the world, we’re
							making this on-demand course available for 90% off</i>.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="faq-text">
					<br />
					<h3>Since it’s held virtually, will I need any special technology to watch online?</h3><br />
					<p>Nope! Our course learning management platform, Teachable, is viewable in any web browser. They
						also have an online app if you want to watch or listen on the go.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="faq-text">
					<br />
					<h3>How long will I have access?</h3><br />
					<p>You can watch the videos at any time. You can also comment below the videos if you need
						clarification on a concept. You’ll have lifetime access to this course. As we add material, you
						continue your access to the new items.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="faq-text">
					<br />
					<h3>How am I supported after the course?</h3><br />
					<p>While you’re getting a ton of helpful insight out of the course, you want the chance to get
						together and get clarification on the material.</p>
					<p>This Masterclass participants have access to two (2) one-hour “<strong>Office Hours</strong>”
						sessions to…</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Discuss sticking points…</li>

				</div>
				<div class="faq-text">
					<br />
					<h3>Are refunds available if I’m not happy with the course?</h3><br />
					<p>Of course. If you watch the first session and decide it’s not right for you, then a full refund
						is issued. After that session we cannot give a refund, but you’ll retain access to the
						materials.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="faq-text">
					<br />
					<h3>When does it start and end?</h3><br />
					<p>These recorded sessions are packaged as a course featuring all the difficult situations you were
						never taught in graduate school. :) You can get help in the comments if needed, or return to the
						material as you get difficult couples down the road. We’re here for you!</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-text">
					<br />
					<h3>Who is this for (and not for)?</h3><br />
					<p>This is for relationship therapists, counselors, psychologists, clergy, and experienced,
						certified coaches. Interns and graduate students may attend and participate only if they are
						seeing couples in therapy.</p>
					<p>This is not for those who work closely with couples in a supportive way but are not therapists
						(teachers, nurses, adoption counselors).</p>
					<p>This Masterclass is not appropriate for those who have not completed graduate coursework in
						couples therapy and psychopathology. Contact us if you have questions prior to joining.</p>
					<p>We want you to be successful and can point you in the right direction even if this isn’t a good
						fit.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-text">
					<br />
					<h3>Are there CEU’s?</h3><br />
					<p>YES! The laws have definitely tightened down for CE credits. Thankfully, our friends at R.
						Cassidy Seminars helped us with the mountains of paperwork needed. This course is covered by R.
						Cassidy Seminars for 10 hours of CEU’s for most MFT, LCSW, Psychologist, MD, CAADAC, and Nursing
						licenses across the country. <a
							href="https://www.academeca.com/CEUReg/SeminarInfo.aspx?seminarId=3338"
							style="text-decoration: none;"><strong>Visit this link for more information</strong></a>.
						Because of the yearly cost R. Cassidy must spend to maintain your access to the CE certificate
						issued, the CE certificate itself costs an additional $40 (paid directly to R. Cassidy).</p>

				</div>
				<div class="faq-text">
					<br />
					<h3>Is there a pre-licensed discount?</h3><br />
					<p>If you are eligible for the Masterclass (see: “Who is this for (and not for)?” answer…) then
						students in their graduate program as well as interns will receive $50 off. Contact us after you
						register so that we can verify your eligibility for the discount. It will then be credited back
						to your card.</p>
