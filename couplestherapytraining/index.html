            <p>Hey all!</p>
            <p>This is Sam Garanzini from the Couples Therapy Training Academy…</p>
            <p>Let’s face it.</p>
            <p>Our industry changed overnight.</p>
            <p>Covid-19, the economy, social unrest, home schooling for all…</p>
            <p><b>But the relationship problems that people are facing didn’t change.
                </b></p>
            <p>Marriages are still struggling with affairs, attachment issues, PTSD/trauma, and high conflict.
            </p>
            <p><u>They now want you to fix their problems through telehealth.<b> Sounds impossible?</b>
                </u></p>
            <p>Many therapists are worried about how best to help couples during this time.</p>
            <p>Therapists are also worried about maintaining a stable income, navigating sliding scale requests, selling
                their online courses, and whether their workshops will return in the same manner prior to Covid-19.</p>
            <p>When it comes to worry and fear, I was right where you’re at many years ago.</p>
            <p>In 2008, during the worst financial crisis since the depression, my overpriced and newly-bought San
                Francisco condo was worth $200k less than I paid for it.</p>
            <p>was offering session-by-session therapy, and I was scared.</p>
            <p>For real.</p>
            <p>My husband and I figured it out the short-term and the long-term plan.</p>
            <p>We set an intention each day to pull ourselves out of that mess.</p>
            <p>And our clients.</p>
            <p>Most importantly, we reached out for help and developed connections with therapists we could trust.</p>
            <p>Given all that has happened recently, I had an idea…</p>
            <p><b>Let me tell you what we were thinking…</b></p>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="text-row">
                <p>I recently ran a survey to the therapists in my circle all about the struggles they’re experiencing
                    with
                    couples, especially as the world is changing around us.</p>
                <p><u><b>The survey results:</b></u> The major challenge that you seem to be experiencing is how to work
                    with high conflict couples, relationships struggling with affairs, attachment wounds, or
                    trauma/PTSD.</p>
                <p>To respond to the needs of your community, you want to learn how to do these things via telehealth.
                </p>
                <p>Some couples are happy to move online with you.</p>
                <p>A few are not. Now what?</p>
                <p>Based on the OVERWHELMING interest I recently created an<b>opportunity for a SMALL number of
                        clinicians to work with myself, and several guest speakers,</b> all trained in sub-specialities
                    to help you become successful.
